Triva
=====

TRIVA is an open-source tool used to analyze traces (in the paj√©
format) registered during the execution of parallel applications. The
tool serves also as a sandbox to the development of new visualization
techniques. Some features include:

* Temporal integration using dynamic time-intervals
* Spatial aggregation through hierarchical traces
* Scalable visual analysis with Squarified Treemaps
* Interactive Graph Visualization with a force-directed algorithm

Triva is released under the [GNU Lesser General Public
Licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) and received funding
from the [CAPES/Cofecub](http://www.capes.gov.br),
[CNPq](http://www.cnpq.br), and
[ANR](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/) agencies. Currently,
the tool is developed as part of the french [INFRA-SONGS ANR
project](http://infra-songs.gforge.inria.fr/).
