This file intends to give the user some help to install Triva2.
We first give an overview about the pre-requisites, and then go
to the basic compiling and installation of the tool.

A. Pre-requisites for Triva2
============================

These are the current pre-requisites for Triva2: GNUstep, Paje and wxWidgets.

A1. Gnustep
-----------

The best way to perform the GNUstep installation is through the
GNUstep-startup package, which can be found here:
http://ftpmain.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/core/gnustep-startup-0.22.0.tar.gz
Just extract the package and run the script InstallGNUstep as root, as follows:
$ tar xfz gnustep-startup-0.22.0.tar.gz
$ cd gnustep-startup-0.22.0
$ sudo InstallGNUstep

The script will perform a series of tests to evaluate if your system has all
the necessary libraries to install the GNUstep environment. This blog has some
packages that must be installed prior to GNUstep installation:
http://gnustep.blogspot.com/2005/12/gnustep-on-ubuntuppc.html

If you use the default directory to install, the GNUstep should be installed
in the /usr/GNUstep directory. If so, you need to source the GNUstep.sh script
to activate the GNUstep environment and proceed to the next pre-requisite. To
do so, please run:
$ source /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

A2. Paje
--------

Triva2 needs Paje. To install it, please download the following package:
http://download.forge.objectweb.org/paje/Paje_1.97.tar.gz
Execute the following commands:
$ source /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
$ tar xfz Paje_1.97.tar.gz
$ cd Paje_1.97
$ make
$ sudo make install
Paje will be installed in the /usr/GNUstep directory. At this point, you can
open paje to see if it is working, with the following command:
$ openapp Paje

A3. wxWidgets
-------------

Triva2 needs wxWidgets version 2.8. The ubuntu linux (and probably
Debian also), has a package named wx2.8-headers that if installed with
apt-get will start all the required dependecies:
$ apt-get install wx2.8-headers

B. Triva2: Compilation
======================

The Triva2 sources can be downloaded here:
http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1119921/Triva-2.0.tar.gz

$ source /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
$ tar xfz Triva2.tgz
$ cd Triva2
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make

Now, you should have a binary ./obj/Triva2.
Execute this file using a Paje trace file as parameter.
