2010-09-07 (try-1.2) Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * New logo for the tool featuring the "Cuia"
  * Complete re-write of the TrivaController (several controllers added)
  * GraphView & GraphConfiguration
    * scale parameter always considered as Global (for now)
    * CRTL + mouse wheel changes the size of all graph objects
    * Better drawing (support for two links between two nodes)
    * Improved highlight support
  * TimeInterval
    * Click on the time slice view opens a bigger window showing the time slice
    * Support for online visualization (combined with Distributed Dimvisual)
  * SquarifiedTreemap
    * Highlighting the hierarchy under the mouse
    * CRTL + scroll wheel changes the offset (space between rectangles)
  * General/Interaction
    * Remembering position of each Triva window on the screen between executions
  * Compare method for trace comparison (splitted views)
    * This method only synchronizes the slice of time between two traces 
    * It can be activated using -s parameter
    * Splitted views must be configured separately (if view is a graph)
  * Merge method for trace comparison (single view of differences)
    * Time slice synchronization (with markers)
    * Differences calculated as a Subtract and Ratio (for two trace files)

2010-06-29 (1.1) Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * New release

2010-06-29 Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * Preparing release 1.1 version
  * Highlighting in Treemap changed (text describing hierarchy and value)
  * GraphView now supports change the size of components (node and links)
    * CRTL + scroll wheel changes their sizes
    * scroll wheel only zoom in and out

2010-06-24 Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * Simplification of the build system (makefiles reworked, simpler configure)
  * Capturing more notifications on the GraphConfiguration, working with filters
  * Every window now contains the name of the trace file in its title
  * Triva closes when at least one of its windows is closed
  * Time Slice integration now normalizes the values to the size of the interval
  * TypeFilter search instances based on regular expression (type enter to use)
  * Bug fixes related to usability issues
     * Treemap's node highlighting during animation now working
     * User do not need to click on visualization windows to make them react
  * GraphView (activated using the -g parameter)
    * Type CRTL + mouse movements to change position of nodes
    * ALT + E exports the nodes coordinates on the screen (to avoid graphviz)
    * ALT + P exports the graph view into an eps file (for your papers)
    * ALT + R (de)activates "recording" mode during animation
    * Mouse dragging moves the drawing
    * Mouse over node highlights it
    * Mouse wheel is used to zoom in and out
    * Using NSAffineTransform for drawing (coordinates and draw simplification)
    * Experimental support for swarm type
  * TreemapView (-t parameter)
    * ALT + P exports the treemap into an eps file (can be used in your papers)
    * ALT + R (de)activates "recording" mode during animation
    * Treemap highlight shows some information about the node (name, value)

2010-04-09 (1.0) Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * Releasing version 1.0 of the tool
  * Added GPLv3 license
  * Using argp to treat command line parameters (--help and stuff)
  * Two new modules "List and CheckTrace" to verify trace integrity.
    They can be enabled by using -l and -c respectively as parameter
    to the triva binary.
  * Fixed some compilation warnings and clean-up development directory
    for release.
