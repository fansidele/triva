2011-12-20 (1.4) Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * Drop autoconf, using pure gnustep makefiles
  * Development code pushed to a git repository
  * Fix several warnings detected by the clang compiler
  * Trace comparison
	* Lines between the markers are colored according to their slope
	* Able to zoom in/out in the view
  * GraphView
	* Fix: Interconnecting the tree according to user configuration
	* Fix: detecting hierarchical interconnections and drawing properly

  TimeIntegration & SpatialIntegration
  * Time/Space integration is splitted in two components
  * Caching is used to keep results, invalidated when time interval changes
  * Space integrates time-integrated data
  Triva Framework
  * Complete re-write, TrivaTreemap and TrivaGraph classes introduced
  * Protocol improved with new notifications and queries
  * TimeSliceDif related classes are deprecated
  * TrivaConfiguration represents a configuration from the user
  * TrivaComposition subclasses deprecated, new introduced (Square and Rhombus)
  GraphConfiguration
  * Configuration re-written, all configurations are always applied to nodes
     * node & edge entries still have to be provided
  * Usable with space-integrated views
  * New parameter added, --gc_dot <file>, where file is a graphviz with node pos
  GraphView (--graph)
  * Hierarchy-capable graph view added, new user interaction:
     * Left click opens an aggregated node and show all its subnodes
     * Right click aggregates a given node and its siblings into their father
  * Force-directed position algorithm, user-controlled with spring/charge/damp
  * Scale-slider for user graph configurations automatically defined
  * New interactions (no need to use Crtl to graphical translate and zoom)
     * Click and Drag translates the graph
     * Mouse wheel ahead and back make a graphical zoom in and out
     * Alt+P prints the current view to a EPS file
  SquarifiedTreemap (--treemap)
  * Hierarchy perception improved with thicker lines according to tree-depth
  * Capacity to select a given node to become the new root node
  * Highlighting works again, showing a summary of time/space integrated values
  * New Interaction mechanisms
     * Left click selects a new root node
     * Right click resets the root node to the default
  Stat (--stat parameter)
  * Stats about the Paje trace file
  Triva
  * New command line parameter scheme (run Triva --help)
  * New parameter --server <port> makes Triva receive commands through a socket
    * All the command-line options are also available through socket, except
      the opening of new trace files
    * Each command passed by socket must be at most 1024 bytes long, and
      the first \n or \r found is transformed in EOL

2010-10-26 (1.2) Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * The "portability" release: Linux and MacOS

2010-09-07 (try-1.2) Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * New logo for the tool featuring the "Cuia"
  * Using GNUstep's Renaissance to be portable with MacOSes
  * Complete re-write of the TrivaController (several controllers added)
  * GraphView & GraphConfiguration
    * scale parameter always considered as Global (for now)
    * CRTL + mouse wheel changes the size of all graph objects
    * Better drawing (support for two links between two nodes)
    * Improved highlight support
  * TimeInterval
    * Click on the time slice view opens a bigger window showing the time slice
    * Support for online visualization (combined with Distributed Dimvisual)
  * SquarifiedTreemap
    * Highlighting the hierarchy under the mouse
    * CRTL + scroll wheel changes the offset (space between rectangles)
  * General/Interaction
    * Remembering position of each Triva window on the screen between executions
  * Compare method for trace comparison (splitted views)
    * This method only synchronizes the slice of time between two traces 
    * It can be activated using -s parameter
    * Splitted views must be configured separately (if view is a graph)
  * Merge method for trace comparison (single view of differences)
    * Time slice synchronization (with markers)
    * Differences calculated as a Subtract and Ratio (for two trace files)

2010-06-29 (1.1) Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * New release

2010-06-29 Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * Preparing release 1.1 version
  * Highlighting in Treemap changed (text describing hierarchy and value)
  * GraphView now supports change the size of components (node and links)
    * CRTL + scroll wheel changes their sizes
    * scroll wheel only zoom in and out

2010-06-24 Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * Simplification of the build system (makefiles reworked, simpler configure)
  * Capturing more notifications on the GraphConfiguration, working with filters
  * Every window now contains the name of the trace file in its title
  * Triva closes when at least one of its windows is closed
  * Time Slice integration now normalizes the values to the size of the interval
  * TypeFilter search instances based on regular expression (type enter to use)
  * Bug fixes related to usability issues
     * Treemap's node highlighting during animation now working
     * User do not need to click on visualization windows to make them react
  * GraphView (activated using the -g parameter)
    * Type CRTL + mouse movements to change position of nodes
    * ALT + E exports the nodes coordinates on the screen (to avoid graphviz)
    * ALT + P exports the graph view into an eps file (for your papers)
    * ALT + R (de)activates "recording" mode during animation
    * Mouse dragging moves the drawing
    * Mouse over node highlights it
    * Mouse wheel is used to zoom in and out
    * Using NSAffineTransform for drawing (coordinates and draw simplification)
    * Experimental support for swarm type
  * TreemapView (-t parameter)
    * ALT + P exports the treemap into an eps file (can be used in your papers)
    * ALT + R (de)activates "recording" mode during animation
    * Treemap highlight shows some information about the node (name, value)

2010-04-09 (1.0) Lucas M. Schnorr <schnorr@gmail.com>
  * Releasing version 1.0 of the tool
  * Added GPLv3 license
  * Using argp to treat command line parameters (--help and stuff)
  * Two new modules "List and CheckTrace" to verify trace integrity.
    They can be enabled by using -l and -c respectively as parameter
    to the triva binary.
  * Fixed some compilation warnings and clean-up development directory
    for release.
